# Smart-Lock

## Overview
The Smart-Lock project is a secure and innovative door control system built using the ESP 8266 for internet connectivity, the ESP 32 for video streaming, and a local server running ResNet50 and VGG16 models for face recognition.

- **ESP8266**: Handles communication and Wi-Fi connectivity.
- **ESP32**: Manages video streaming for face recognition.
- **Local Server**: Runs face recognition models.

## Features
- **Unlock Methods**:
  - **RFID**: Unlock the door using an authorized RFID card.
  - **PIN Code**: Enter a PIN code via a keypad or screen.
  - **Face Recognition**: Uses a camera to capture faces for verification.

- **Security Features**:
  - Alarm after three incorrect PIN attempts.
  - Camera snapshots of unauthorized access attempts.
  - Detailed logs of unlocking attempts.
  - Notifications to owners in case of suspicious activity.

- **Display**: Shows system status and a simple user menu.

## System Activation
The system is activated when a proximity sensor detects a person near the door. The camera then captures the image and sends it to a local server for face recognition.

## Setup
### Hardware:
- **ESP 8266** (for lock manipulation)
- **ESP 32** (for video streaming)
- RFID Reader
- Keypad or screen for PIN input
- Camera (for face recognition)
- Proximity sensor
- Buzzer (alarm)
- Display

### Software:
- Arduino IDE
- Libraries for RFID, keypad, Wi-Fi, and face recognition (ResNet50 and VGG16)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/jokicjovan/Smart-Lock.git`

2. Install required libraries in the Arduino IDE.

3. Configure Wi-Fi credentials in the code.

4. Upload the code to the ESP modules.

5. Set up the local server for face recognition (ResNet50, VGG16).

## Usage
- **RFID**: Scan an authorized RFID card to unlock the door.
- **PIN Code**: Enter the correct PIN code on the keypad or screen.
- **Face Recognition**: The system uses the camera for face verification (if enabled).
